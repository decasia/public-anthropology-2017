# Luister

---

## How do you do anthropological analysis?

---

## Largely: by observing how things are *represented.*

---

# Questions one can ask

- Who is speaking? Who is not speaking?
- Who and what is being spoken about?
- How is opposition characterized?
- What is left unsaid?

---

# Gender as an object of analysis

- Gender identities are *socially ascribed* (based on bodies, clothes, language. etc)
- Gender roles change historically (e.g., transgender identities, images of masculinity & femininity)

---
